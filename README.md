## Install

1. [Download dotcity-websocket-broker](https://github.com/wotcity/dotcity-websocket-broker/releases).
2. Run `$ cd dotcity-websocket-broker` to change the directory.
3. Run `$ npm install` to install the dependencies if you don't already have them.
4. Run `$ node index.js` to start the broker server.

Please try `ws://wot.city` at [WoT.City](http://wotcity.com) first before you start your own IoT cloud.

### Prerequisites

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). Note: Node should be with a version above 0.10.x.

## Usage

To send the data over the Internet, IoT devices should use the url below to establish a connection with the server.

```
ws://[hostname]/object/[name]/send
```

You must specify an object name and your hostname. For example:

```
ws://wot.city/object/554785c7173b2e5563000007/send
```

To receive data from the server, the frontend should use the url below to establish a connection with the server.

```
ws://[hostname]/object/[name]/viewer
```

Also, you need to specify the object name and hostname. For example:

```
ws://wot.city/object/554785c7173b2e5563000007/viewer
```

An physical object has two significant resources, *send* and *viewer*. *send* is to send device data to WoT.City, and WoT.City receives data streams over Websocket connection. *viewer* is used by frontend to receive real-time data over the connection.

dotcity-websocket-broker is a broker that it receives sensor data over Websocket connection and routes data streams to frontend Websocket clients.
